-- University

-- (a)

-- Find names of students(no duplicate) take CS
select distinct name from student
inner join takes on student.id = takes.id
where takes.course_id like 'CS%';

-- Find id & name of students not taken any course before spring 2009
select distinct student.id, name from student
left join takes on student.id = takes.id
where takes.year is null or not takes.year < 2009;

-- For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that department
select dept_name, id, name, salary from instructor i
where salary = (select max(salary) from instructor where dept_name = i.dept_name)
order by i.dept_name; 

-- Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum salary 
-- computed by the preceding query.
select dept_name, salary 
from instructor
where salary = (select min(salary) from (select dept_name, id, name, salary from instructor i
where salary = (select max(salary) from instructor where dept_name = i.dept_name)));

-- (b)

-- i. Create a new CS-001 course in computer science, titled Weekly Seminar, with 10 credits.
insert into course
values ('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'Comp. Sci.', 10);

-- ii. Create a new CS-002 course in computer science, titled Monthly Seminar, with 0 credits.
-- insert into course
-- values ('CS-002', 'Monthly Seminar', 'Comp. Sci.', 0);
-- iii. Explanation: Violated the constraint that courses should have credits, if change credits
-- to some number that is bigger than 0 than we can creat the course.

-- iv. Create a section of the CS-001 course in Fall 2009, with section id of 1.
insert into section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
values ('CS-001', 1, 'Fall', 2009);
-- v. Explanation: Because we do not know those information, so we set them as null

-- vi. Enrol every student in the CS department in the section you created in the previous statement.
insert into takes (id, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
(select student.id, section.course_id, section.sec_id, section.semester, section.year from student, section
where student.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and section.course_id = 'CS-001');

-- vii. Delete all enrolments in the above section where the studentâ€™s name is Zhang.
delete from (select * from takes inner join student on takes.id = student.id
where takes.id = student.id 
and student.name = 'Zhang'
and takes.course_id = 'CS-001'); 

-- viii. Delete all takes tuples corresponding to any section & course with substring'database' of the title
delete from (select * from takes 
where takes.course_id in (select section.course_id from section
inner join course on section.course_id = course.course_id
where takes.course_id = course.course_id and lower(course.title) like '%database%'));

-- ix. Delete the course CS-001.
delete from course
where course.course_id = 'CS-001';
-- x. Explanation: when course 'CS-001' was deleted, the data in its related table was also automatically
-- deleted, this is because takes, section and course linked together with 'course_id'.

-- Accident

-- i. Find the number of accidents in which the cars belonging to Jane Rowling were involved.
select count(person.name) 
from accident, person, participated
where accident.report_number = participated.report_number
and participated.driver_id = person.driver_id 
and person.name = 'Jane Rowling'; 

-- ii. Update the amount of damage for the car with license number KUY 629 
-- in the accident with report number 7897423 to 2500.
update participated
set damage_amount = 2500
where report_number = 7897423
and license = 'KUY 629';

-- iii. List the name of the persons that participated in accidents along with the total damage
-- caused (descend) but only include those whose total damage is above 3000.
with total_damage as 
(select name, person.driver_id, sum(damage_amount) 
from person, participated
where person.driver_id = participated.driver_id
group by person.driver_id, name
having sum(damage_amount) > 3000)
select name from total_damage
order by name desc;

-- iv. Create a view that returns the locations where accidents have occurred along with 
-- the average amount of damage in that location. Call this view average_damage_per_location.
create view average_damage_per_location
(
    location,
    average_damage
)
as (select location, avg(damage_amount) from accident, participated
where accident.report_number = participated.report_number
group by accident.location);

-- v. Use the average_damage_per_location location you have just created to find 
-- the location that has the highest average damage.
select location
from average_damage_per_location
where average_damage = (select max(average_damage)
from average_damage_per_location);

drop view average_damage_per_location;
